## Project Overview

This is a small but neat project to process images and identify breeds of dogs.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I had to make important design decisions about the user experience for the app.  There are several challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  This imperfect but workable solution should nonetheless create a fun user experience!
